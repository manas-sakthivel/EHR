3.3 Security Architecture and Integrity Assurance
3.3.1 Role-Based Access Control and Defense-in-Depth Security

Security in the proposed Electronic Health Records (EHR) system is enforced using a defense-in-depth strategy, where multiple independent security mechanisms operate in tandem to protect sensitive medical data. This approach ensures that even if one layer is compromised, the system as a whole remains secure. Specifically, the system combines application-layer validation with immutable smart contract–level enforcement, anchoring trust directly in the blockchain rather than in a centralized server.

At the application layer, user authentication and preliminary authorization checks ensure that only registered users can initiate actions. However, the ultimate authority for access control resides in the smart contracts, which deterministically validate permissions before any state-changing operation is executed. This design prevents privilege escalation even if the backend or API layer is compromised.

The system defines distinct user roles with clearly bounded privileges:

Administrator (Admin)

The administrator functions as the system’s governance authority. Admin responsibilities include:

Registering and managing doctor and laboratory accounts

Viewing all medical records and associated audit logs

Invalidating files that are detected or reported as compromised

Maintaining overall system integrity and policy enforcement

Critically, administrative actions are also subject to blockchain logging. This ensures that even the most privileged role cannot act without leaving a permanent and auditable trail.

Doctor / Laboratory

Doctors and laboratories act as authorized data producers and verifiers, with permissions restricted to:

Uploading medical files for patients under their authorized scope

Verifying file integrity against blockchain-stored hashes

Viewing only those medical records they have uploaded themselves

They are explicitly prevented from deleting, modifying, or invalidating records, thereby minimizing insider risk and enforcing the principle of least privilege.

Patient

Patients are treated as data owners with full transparency but no modification authority. They can:

View all medical records associated with their identity

Independently verify the authenticity of their records

However, patients cannot upload, modify, or invalidate files, protecting the system from accidental or malicious data corruption.

All role permissions are encoded directly in the smart contract logic. As a result, even a malicious backend, forged request, or compromised server cannot bypass authorization rules. Every attempted and successful operation emits blockchain events, enabling complete accountability and forensic traceability.

3.3.2 Tamper Detection and Auditability

Tamper detection constitutes the core security guarantee of the proposed system. Unlike conventional EHR platforms that rely on centralized logs or database checksums, this system provides cryptographic proof of integrity backed by blockchain immutability.

When a medical file is uploaded, the system computes its SHA-256 cryptographic hash, which serves as a unique fingerprint of the file’s contents. Due to the avalanche effect inherent in cryptographic hash functions, even a one-bit change in the file results in a completely different hash value. This makes undetected modification computationally infeasible.

The computed hash, along with metadata and decentralized storage references, is stored immutably on the blockchain via the smart contract. Once recorded, this reference cannot be altered, overwritten, or deleted.

During verification:

The user uploads the file to be verified

The system recomputes its SHA-256 hash

The computed hash is compared against the blockchain-stored reference

The outcome is definitive:

Hash match → cryptographic proof of authenticity

Hash mismatch → conclusive evidence of tampering

Each verification attempt—successful or failed—is logged on-chain via blockchain events, creating non-repudiable, forensic-grade evidence of integrity checks. Verification attempts cannot be hidden, selectively reported, or retrospectively altered.

In the event of confirmed tampering, an administrator may invalidate the affected record. This invalidation:

Does not delete or modify historical data

Adds a new immutable FileInvalidated record

Transparently flags the file as compromised for all future access

Because the blockchain ledger is append-only and distributed, no entity—insider or attacker—can retroactively erase or manipulate evidence. This provides strong protection against internal misuse and external attacks, making the system suitable for high-assurance healthcare environments.

Role-Based Access Control and Defense-in-Depth Security

Security within the system is implemented using a defense-in-depth strategy, wherein multiple independent security layers jointly enforce access control and operational constraints. This approach ensures that a failure or compromise at one layer does not result in a complete system breach. Specifically, application-layer validations are complemented by immutable smart contract–level enforcement, ensuring that security guarantees are anchored in the blockchain rather than relying solely on server-side trust.

At the application layer, user authentication and basic authorization checks are performed to ensure only legitimate users can initiate actions. However, the final authority for permission enforcement resides within the smart contracts, which prevents privilege escalation even in the event of a malicious or compromised backend.

The system defines clearly separated roles with minimal, purpose-specific privileges:

Administrator (Admin)
The administrator functions as the system governor and trust anchor. Admin privileges include:

Registering and managing doctor and laboratory accounts

Viewing all uploaded medical records and associated audit logs

Invalidating files that have been detected or reported as compromised

Overseeing system integrity without modifying historical records

Importantly, even administrative actions are fully logged on-chain, ensuring that admins are accountable and cannot act without leaving an immutable trace.

Doctor / Laboratory
Doctors and labs operate as authorized data producers and verifiers. Their capabilities are intentionally restricted to:

Uploading medical files only for patients they are authorized to handle

Verifying the integrity of uploaded files using blockchain-stored hashes

Viewing only those records they have personally uploaded

They are explicitly prevented from altering, deleting, or invalidating records, preserving data integrity and minimizing insider risk.

Patient
Patients are treated as data owners with full transparency but zero modification authority. They can:

View all medical files associated with their identity

Independently verify file authenticity against blockchain records

However, they cannot upload, modify, or invalidate any records, preventing accidental or malicious data corruption.

All role permissions are hard-coded into the smart contract logic, meaning access checks are executed deterministically on-chain. As a result, even a malicious backend, rogue API call, or compromised server cannot bypass role restrictions. Every successful or failed state-changing action generates a blockchain event, creating a comprehensive, tamper-proof audit trail that supports post-incident forensic investigation and compliance verification.

3.3.4 Tamper Detection and Auditability

Tamper detection represents the core security guarantee and primary technical contribution of the proposed system. Unlike traditional EHR systems that rely on database access logs or centralized checksums, this system provides cryptographic, mathematically verifiable proof of data integrity.

When a medical file is uploaded, the system computes its SHA-256 cryptographic hash, which serves as a unique and fixed-length fingerprint of the file’s contents. Due to the avalanche effect inherent in cryptographic hash functions, even a one-bit modification in the file produces a completely different hash value. This property makes SHA-256 highly suitable for detecting even the most subtle forms of tampering.

The computed hash, along with relevant metadata and storage references, is stored immutably on the blockchain via the smart contract. Because blockchain records are append-only and distributed across nodes, this hash cannot be altered, overwritten, or removed once recorded.

During the file verification process:

The user re-uploads the file for validation

The system recomputes the SHA-256 hash of the submitted file

This newly computed hash is compared against the original hash stored on-chain

The outcome is definitive:

A matching hash cryptographically proves file authenticity and integrity

A mismatched hash conclusively proves tampering, regardless of file size or modification type

Crucially, the verification outcome—whether successful or failed—is itself recorded on-chain through blockchain events. This design ensures that verification attempts cannot be hidden or selectively reported, producing forensic-grade, non-repudiable evidence of file integrity checks.

In confirmed tampering scenarios, the system supports administrative invalidation of the affected file. This invalidation:

Does not delete or modify historical data, preserving evidentiary value

Adds a new immutable record (FileInvalidated) explicitly flagging the file as compromised

Ensures that all future references to the file are transparently marked as invalid

The underlying append-only nature of blockchain guarantees that no participant—whether administrator, insider, or attacker—can retroactively suppress evidence of tampering or erase past actions. This protects the system against both external attacks and insider threats, making it suitable for high-assurance environments such as healthcare, legal audits, and regulatory oversight.

3.4 Results and Discussion

The performance and effectiveness of the proposed blockchain-based EHR system were evaluated through a series of functional, security, and usability experiments. The results demonstrate that the system successfully achieves its primary objectives of data integrity protection, tamper detection, access control enforcement, and transparent auditability, while remaining usable within realistic healthcare workflows. This section discusses the observed outcomes and their implications.

3.4.1 System Security and Integrity

Experimental testing confirms that the system reliably detects all forms of unauthorized file modification, validating the correctness and robustness of the integrity verification mechanism. Multiple test cases were executed in which uploaded medical files were subjected to intentional tampering, including:

Byte-level modifications

Metadata alterations

Partial content replacement

In all cases, even the slightest change to the file resulted in a completely different SHA-256 hash, which did not match the value immutably stored on the blockchain. As a result, the verification process consistently flagged the altered files as tampered.

This behavior highlights two critical security properties of the system:

Cryptographic Sensitivity: The use of SHA-256 ensures that the system is sensitive to even minimal modifications, providing strong guarantees against undetected tampering.

Immutability Enforcement: Because the original hash is stored on the blockchain, it cannot be altered, overwritten, or forged—ensuring that integrity verification relies on an unchangeable reference.

The combination of cryptographic hashing with blockchain immutability therefore provides strong end-to-end integrity assurance, exceeding what can be achieved using traditional centralized database logs or checksum approaches.

3.4.2 User Roles and Access Analysis

The role-based access control (RBAC) framework was evaluated by simulating authorized and unauthorized user actions across all defined roles: administrator, doctor, laboratory, and patient. Results indicate that role enforcement remains consistent and deterministic across both the application layer and the smart contract layer.

Unauthorized actions—such as:

A patient attempting to upload or invalidate a file

A doctor trying to access another doctor’s records

A non-admin attempting to register users or invalidate files

were consistently rejected at the smart contract level, even if the requests were manually crafted or bypassed application-level checks. This demonstrates that the ultimate authority for access control resides on-chain, making the system resilient against backend manipulation or API misuse.

Additionally, every access attempt—successful or failed—is recorded through blockchain events. This ensures:

Prevention: Unauthorized operations cannot succeed

Accountability: All attempts are traceable to the initiating identity

Forensic Readiness: Historical actions can be reconstructed during audits or investigations

These findings confirm that the RBAC design effectively minimizes insider threats and enforces the principle of least privilege, which is essential in healthcare security systems.

3.4.3 File Verification and Tamper Evidence

The file verification mechanism was evaluated under both normal and adversarial conditions to assess its reliability and evidentiary strength. The system consistently produced clear, on-chain proof of file authenticity or tampering through deterministic hash comparisons.

Each verification attempt generates a corresponding blockchain event, recording:

The file identifier

The verifier’s identity

The verification timestamp

The verification outcome (match or mismatch)

Because these events are permanently stored on the blockchain, they form a non-repudiable evidentiary record. This ensures that no party can later deny:

The existence of a verification attempt

The outcome of that verification

The identity of the verifying entity

Such properties are particularly important in healthcare and legal contexts, where disputes may arise regarding the authenticity or modification of medical records. The system thereby provides a technically and legally defensible audit trail, suitable for compliance verification and dispute resolution.

3.4.4 Audit Trail and Transparency

A key strength of the system is its comprehensive and transparent audit trail, achieved through event logging on an immutable blockchain ledger. Every critical state-changing action—including file uploads, verification attempts, and administrative invalidations—is permanently recorded.

Because blockchain records are:

Append-only

Cryptographically secured

Distributed across nodes

no centralized authority can modify, censor, or erase historical actions. This enables independent verification of system behavior by external auditors, regulatory bodies, or institutional reviewers without requiring trust in the backend server or system administrators.

This level of transparency is particularly valuable for regulated domains such as healthcare, as it:

Enhances institutional accountability

Supports regulatory audits

Improves patient trust in digital record systems

Thus, the system directly addresses long-standing concerns related to opaque data handling and unverifiable audit logs in traditional EHR platforms.

3.4.5 Usability and Workflow Integration

Despite the sophisticated cryptographic and blockchain mechanisms operating beneath the surface, the system is designed to be user-centric and workflow-friendly. Usability testing focused on ensuring that clinicians, laboratory personnel, and patients could interact with the system without requiring blockchain or cryptography expertise.

Key usability observations include:

File upload and verification workflows closely mirror familiar web-based document systems

Blockchain operations such as hashing, contract calls, and event handling are fully abstracted from end users

Verification results are presented in a clear and interpretable manner

This abstraction ensures that security enhancements do not introduce workflow friction, thereby supporting realistic clinical adoption. The system demonstrates that advanced security guarantees can be delivered without compromising usability, which is essential for real-world healthcare environments.

3.4.6 Limitations and Future Enhancements

While the experimental results validate the conceptual and technical soundness of the system, certain limitations are acknowledged.

The current implementation uses:

A local Ethereum blockchain (Ganache)

A locally hosted IPFS node

These choices are suitable for development and evaluation but do not fully reflect production-scale deployment constraints.

Future enhancements will focus on:

Production-grade blockchain deployment, including public or consortium Ethereum networks

Digital signature integration to cryptographically bind identities to file uploads and verifications

Batch verification and gas optimization to improve scalability and performance

Integration with hospital EHR standards such as HL7 and FHIR, enabling interoperability with existing healthcare systems

Addressing these limitations will further enhance scalability, regulatory compliance, and real-world applicability.

📌 Overall Interpretation

The results demonstrate that the proposed system not only functions correctly but also meets and exceeds security, accountability, and usability expectations for academic and practical healthcare applications. By combining cryptographic techniques, decentralized storage, and immutable audit logs, the system provides a robust foundation for trustworthy digital medical records management.

However, the ultimate authority for access control resides in the smart contracts, which deterministically validate permissions before any state-changing operation is executed. This design prevents privilege escalation even if the backend or API layer is compromised.

The system defines distinct user roles with clearly bounded privileges:

Administrator (Admin)

The administrator functions as the system’s governance authority. Admin responsibilities include:

Registering and managing doctor and laboratory accounts

Viewing all medical records and associated audit logs

Invalidating files that are detected or reported as compromised

Verifying file integrity against blockchain-stored hashes

Viewing only those medical records they have uploaded themselves

They are explicitly prevented from deleting, modifying, or invalidating records, thereby minimizing insider risk and enforcing the principle of least privilege.

Patient

Patients are treated as data owners with full transparency but no modification authority. They can:

View all medical records associated with their identity

Independently verify the authenticity of their records

However, patients cannot upload, modify, or invalidate files, protecting the system from accidental or malicious data corruption.

All role permissions are encoded directly in the smart contract logic. As a result, even a malicious backend, forged request, or compromised server cannot bypass authorization rules. Every attempted and successful operation emits blockchain events, enabling complete accountability and forensic traceability.

3.3.2 Tamper Detection and Auditability

Tamper detection constitutes the core security guarantee of the proposed system. Unlike conventional EHR platforms that rely on centralized logs or database checksums, this system provides cryptographic proof of integrity backed by blockchain immutability.

When a medical file is uploaded, the system computes its SHA-256 cryptographic hash, which serves as a unique fingerprint of the file’s contents. Due to the avalanche effect inherent in cryptographic hash functions, even a one-bit change in the file results in a completely different hash value. This makes undetected modification computationally infeasible.

The computed hash, along with metadata and decentralized storage references, is stored immutably on the blockchain via the smart contract. Once recorded, this reference cannot be altered, overwritten, or deleted.

During verification:

The user uploads the file to be verified

The system recomputes its SHA-256 hash

The computed hash is compared against the blockchain-stored reference

The outcome is definitive:

Hash match → cryptographic proof of authenticity

Hash mismatch → conclusive evidence of tampering

Each verification attempt—successful or failed—is logged on-chain via blockchain events, creating non-repudiable, forensic-grade evidence of integrity checks. Verification attempts cannot be hidden, selectively reported, or retrospectively altered.

In the event of confirmed tampering, an administrator may invalidate the affected record. This invalidation:

Does not delete or modify historical data

Adds a new immutable FileInvalidated record

Transparently flags the file as compromised for all future access

Because the blockchain ledger is append-only and distributed, no entity—insider or attacker—can retroactively erase or manipulate evidence. This provides strong protection against internal misuse and external attacks, making the system suitable for high-assurance healthcare environments.

3.4 Results and Discussion

The proposed system was evaluated through functional testing, security simulations, and usability assessment. The results demonstrate that the system successfully achieves its design goals of integrity assurance, tamper detection, access enforcement, and transparent auditability, while remaining practical for real-world healthcare workflows.

3.4.1 System Security and Integrity

Experimental testing confirms that the system reliably detects all forms of file modification. Test cases included byte-level edits, partial content changes, and metadata manipulation. In every scenario, the recomputed file hash differed from the blockchain-stored hash, resulting in immediate detection.

These results validate:

The cryptographic robustness of SHA-256 hashing

The effectiveness of blockchain immutability as a trusted integrity anchor

The system thus provides end-to-end integrity protection that surpasses traditional centralized database solutions.

3.4.2 User Roles and Access Analysis

Role enforcement was tested by simulating both valid and invalid actions across all user roles. Unauthorized attempts—such as patients trying to upload records or doctors accessing other doctors’ files—were deterministically rejected at the smart contract level.

These results confirm that:

Access control is not dependent on backend trust

Privilege escalation is cryptographically prevented

All actions, including failed attempts, are auditable

The RBAC framework effectively enforces least privilege while supporting accountability and post-incident investigation.

3.4.3 File Verification and Tamper Evidence

The verification mechanism consistently produced clear, on-chain evidence for every integrity check. Each verification event permanently records the verifier identity, timestamp, file reference, and verification outcome.

This creates a technically and legally defensible audit trail, suitable for regulatory compliance, institutional audits, and dispute resolution in healthcare environments.

3.4.4 Audit Trail and Transparency

All critical system actions—including uploads, verifications, and invalidations—are logged on an immutable blockchain ledger. Because these records are append-only, cryptographically secured, and decentralized, independent auditors can verify system behavior without relying on trust in administrators or servers.

This transparency directly addresses long-standing challenges associated with opaque and mutable audit logs in traditional EHR systems.

3.4.5 Usability and Workflow Integration

Despite the use of advanced cryptographic and blockchain mechanisms, the system provides a user-friendly web interface. Blockchain operations such as hashing, smart contract calls, and event handling are fully abstracted from users.

Clinicians, labs, and patients interact with familiar workflows for file upload, verification, and viewing, demonstrating that strong security guarantees can coexist with high usability.

3.4.6 Limitations and Future Enhancements

The current implementation uses a local Ethereum blockchain and IPFS node, which are appropriate for development and evaluation but not fully representative of production environments.

Future enhancements will include:

Deployment on production-grade or consortium blockchain networks

Digital signatures for stronger identity binding

Batch verification and gas optimization for scalability

Integration with healthcare standards such as HL7 and FHIR

These improvements will further enhance scalability, interoperability, and regulatory compliance.
